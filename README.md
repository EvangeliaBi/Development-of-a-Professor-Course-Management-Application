This is an application for managing teachers for the school administration, with a graphical interface that allows the management of teachers and subjects. The data is stored in a database through an active connection. The main functions are: 

• Inserting new records (teachers and subjects). 
• Searching and viewing existing teachers. 
• Updating teacher details. 
• Deleting teacher records.

The application was developed in Java using JDK 23.0.1 for development, combined with the Eclipse IDE. For the GUI, the WindowBuilder plugin was implemented, which generates automatic code and allows simultaneous viewing of the design and the source code of each window. The database was developed with MySQL Workbench 8.0.41 and MySQL Server of the same version for sending queries and retrieving information.
